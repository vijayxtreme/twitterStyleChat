##Simple Twitter-style chat box

This is a simple chat (Twitter like) using GET & POST requests.  One just needs an account at mlab to use.  Once you have an account, create a database and a database user, then assign the username and password to the link provided in models/post.js.

After that you can start using the app with nodemon server.js
